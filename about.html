    <h2>My Game Development Journey</h2>
    <p>
      For as long as I can remember, I’ve loved playing video games and knew deep down that I wanted to make them myself. I was constantly brainstorming and writing down ways to improve my favorite games—mainly balance tweaks and fun new features. I'd often share my ideas with other players and always got very positive feedback, which gave me confidence that I had a gift for game design.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 6th grade, I began attending tech summer camps where I started to learn programming so I could turn my ideas into real games. I absolutely fell in love with programming and the process of making games. That was when I knew for sure that making games was what I wanted to do professionally. In just my first week of programming, I created a text-based RPG featuring a dungeon with multiple rooms, a turn-based combat system, spells, items, a level-up mechanic, multiple enemies and a final boss. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I kept learning programming through high school and later majored in Game Design and Development at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), where I was able to combine my love of coding with my passion for making games. Throughout my time at RIT, I had the opportunity to create many games, both solo and as part of a team. In all of these group projects, I was the one who came up with the game concept and served as the team leader. I graduated magna cum laude in December 2024 and I’m very excited to begin my career as a developer.

    <h2>Tutoring Business</h2>
    <p>
      I run a small personal tutoring business where I teach programming to elementary through high school students. I focus on both programming fundamentals and creative projects like simple games. It’s incredibly rewarding to help young learners grow their skills and discover the joy of coding.
