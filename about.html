    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>I'm a game developer with a strong passion for technical design and programming. I specialize in C# and Unity, and I enjoy building interactive, engaging experiences for players. Whether working solo or collaborating with a team, I love turning creative ideas into working systems that are both functional and fun.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies & Passions</h2>
    <p>Outside of game development, I enjoy a variety of creative and relaxing activities. I love experimenting in the kitchen and perfecting new recipes. In my downtime, you'll often find me gaming, watching movies or TV shows, or casually tossing a frisbee around with friends. I also enjoy learning new languages—currently, I’ve been focusing on improving my Spanish. These hobbies help me recharge and often inspire new ideas for my projects.</p>

    <h2>Teaching & Mentorship</h2>
    <p>In addition to game development, I’ve been tutoring students in programming and game design. I’m currently teaching two students programming basics and guiding them through interactive game design projects. I find great joy in helping others develop their skills and watching them grow.</p>
