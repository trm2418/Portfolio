      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Solo Developer</p>
      <p><strong>Setting:</strong> Solo Personal Project</p>
      <p><strong>Timeframe:</strong> June-December 2020</p>
      <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Unity (C#)</p>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Dungeon Heroes is an endless dungeon crawler with turn-based 8v8 combat. Players assemble a team of unique heroes and descend into an endless dungeon filled with enemies, treasures, and powerful bosses.</p>
      <p>This was the first game I made using Unity. The concept was mostly inspired by the game Soda Dungeon and classic RPGs in general. I originally created a text-based version of the game over the summer, then remade it in Unity once I started learning it in class the following semester. That semester I had a lighter course load due to COVID, so I decided to challenge myself by making a full game as a personal project alongside my schoolwork.</p>
      <p>Creating Dungeon Heroes taught me just how much goes into building a game from scratch. Everything aside from basic Unity concepts was completely new to me, and I learned a lot just by diving in and figuring things out as I went. It was the first time I made one of my game ideas truly come to life, and it really confirmed for me that game development is what I want to do.</p>
      <p><strong>My Contributions:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed and implemented the full turn-based combat system from scratch</li>
        <li>Implemented stat buffs, debuffs, and status effects</li>
        <li>Created 9 unique hero characters using a Unity character creator asset pack</li>
        <li>Designed 4-6 combat abilities per hero to differentiate their playstyles</li>
        <li>Created 9 unique pets, each providing a different party-wide buff</li>
        <li>Designed 12 unique enemies and 2 bosses, each with distinct stats and attacking abilities</li>
        <li>Built a shop system where players can buy permanent upgrades after each run</li>
        <li>Developed a combat log that displays detailed text entries for all in-battle actions</li>
        <li>Implemented a dynamic enemy scaling system to increase difficulty as the player progresses</li>
      </ul>
