      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Concept Creator, Project Lead, Solo Developer</p>
      <p><strong>Setting:</strong> Internship (9 person team)</p>
      <p><strong>Timeframe:</strong> January 2024-Present</p>
      <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Unity (C#), Trello</p>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Heisteria is a 2-4 player couch co-op party game with top-down 3D graphics and stealth elements. Work with your friends to pull off daring bank heists in the nick of time – hold off guards, navigate security systems, crack open vaults and escape with your fortune!</p>
      <p>Heisteria was the final game I worked on at RIT, and in many ways, it felt like the culmination of everything I’d learned throughout my time there. The concept was inspired by the chaotic couch co-op games I love playing with friends — titles like Overcooked and Moving Out. It started as a class project before evolving into a full-time internship through RIT’s MAGIC Maker Program at MAGIC Spell Studios.</p>
      <p>This project pushed me to apply a blend of advanced programming, game design principles, Unity expertise, and team leadership. I led a nine-person team using agile workflows and took personal responsibility for building every core system in the game. I poured my heart into the development process, often working far beyond the required 35 hours per week to meet deadlines and deliver the best possible experience for our showcase events. Heisteria is the project I'm most proud of — not just for its quality, but for how much I grew while building it.</p>
