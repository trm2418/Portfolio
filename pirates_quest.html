      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Concept Creator, Project Lead, Lead Developer</p>
      <p><strong>Setting:</strong> Academic Group Project (4 person team)</p>
      <p><strong>Timeframe:</strong> February-May 2023</p>
      <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Unity (C#), Trello</p>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Pirate’s Quest is a roguelite adventure with grid-based tactics combat. Players explore islands, assemble a crew, collect treasure, and battle enemies in a procedurally generated world. When a run ends, players earn legacy points that can be spent on permanent upgrades to improve future attempts.</p>
      <p>This was the second-to-last group project I worked on at RIT, and it remains one of the projects I'm most proud of. The concept was heavily inspired by Slay the Spire — a game I was obsessed with at the time — and also took cues from Fire Emblem, Soda Dungeon, and Into the Breach. I wanted to capture the strategic depth and replayability of those games, while experimenting with a different setting and combat system.</p>
      <p>Working on Pirate’s Quest helped me sharpen my programming and design skills by building a full tactics combat engine from scratch. I also gained experience collaborating closely with teammates to balance gameplay systems and improve player experience through iteration and feedback.</p>

      <p><strong>My Contributions:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed and implemented the full grid-based tactics combat system</li>
        <li>Generated randomized combat encounters with difficulty that scales based on run progression</li>
        <li>Created a fully scripted tutorial sequence to teach core mechanics through interactive gameplay</li>
        <li>Developed responsive visual feedback for combat events through effect popups and attack animations</li>
        <li>Programmed unique combat abilities for each of the six crew members, emphasizing distinct playstyles and team synergy</li>
        <li>Came up with the original idea for the game and all of the core mechanics</li>
        <li>Managed the team using agile workflows and Trello</li>
        <li>Gave weekly sprint reports to our professor</li>
      </ul>
