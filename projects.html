    <!-- Heisteria -->
    <div class="project">
      <img src="assets/heisteria.png" alt="Heisteria" />
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Concept Creator, Project Lead, Solo Developer</p>
      <p><strong>Setting:</strong> Internship (9 person team)</p>
      <p><strong>Timeframe:</strong> January 2024-Present</p>
      <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Unity (C#), Trello</p>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Heisteria is a 2-4 player couch co-op party game with top-down 3D graphics and stealth elements. Work with your friends to pull off daring bank heists in the nick of time – hold off guards, navigate security systems, crack open vaults and escape with your fortune!</p>
      <p>Heisteria was the final game I worked on at RIT, and in many ways, it felt like the culmination of everything I’d learned throughout my time there. The concept was inspired by the chaotic couch co-op games I love playing with friends — titles like Overcooked and Moving Out. It started as a class project before evolving into a full-time internship through RIT’s MAGIC Maker Program at MAGIC Spell Studios.</p>
      <p>This project pushed me to apply a blend of advanced programming, game design principles, Unity expertise, and team leadership. I led a nine-person team using agile workflows and took personal responsibility for building every core system in the game. I poured my heart into the development process, often working far beyond the required 35 hours per week to meet deadlines and deliver the best possible experience for our showcase events. Heisteria is the project I'm most proud of — not just for its quality, but for how much I grew while building it.</p>

    <!-- Pirate's Quest -->
    <div class="project">
      <img src="assets/pirates quest.png" alt="Pirate's Quest" />
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Concept Creator, Project Lead, Lead Developer</p>
      <p><strong>Setting:</strong> Academic Group Project (4 person team)</p>
      <p><strong>Timeframe:</strong> February-May 2023</p>
      <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Unity (C#), Trello</p>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Pirate’s Quest is a roguelite adventure with grid-based tactics combat. Players explore islands, assemble a crew, collect treasure, and battle enemies in a procedurally generated world. When a run ends, players earn legacy points that can be spent on permanent upgrades to improve future attempts.</p>
      <p>This was the second-to-last group project I worked on at RIT, and it remains one of the projects I'm most proud of. The concept was heavily inspired by Slay the Spire — a game I was obsessed with at the time — and also took cues from Fire Emblem, Soda Dungeon, and Into the Breach. I wanted to capture the strategic depth and replayability of those games, while experimenting with a different setting and combat system.</p>
      <p>Working on Pirate’s Quest helped me sharpen my programming and design skills by building a full tactics combat engine from scratch. I also gained experience collaborating closely with teammates to balance gameplay systems and improve player experience through iteration and feedback.</p>

      <p><strong>My Contributions:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed and implemented the full grid-based tactics combat system</li>
        <li>Generated randomized combat encounters with difficulty that scales based on run progression</li>
        <li>Created a fully scripted tutorial sequence to teach core mechanics through interactive gameplay</li>
        <li>Developed responsive visual feedback for combat events through effect popups and attack animations</li>
        <li>Programmed unique combat abilities for each of the six crew members, emphasizing distinct playstyles and team synergy</li>
        <li>Came up with the original idea for the game and all of the core mechanics</li>
        <li>Managed the team using agile workflows and Trello</li>
        <li>Gave weekly sprint reports to our professor</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- The Twisting Labyrinth -->
    <div class="project">
      <img src="assets/twisting labyrinth.png" alt="The Twisting Labyrinth" />
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Concept Creator, Project Lead, Lead Developer</p>
      <p><strong>Setting:</strong> Academic Group Project (5 person team)</p>
      <p><strong>Timeframe:</strong> January-May 2022</p>
      <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Unity (C#), Trello</p>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Twisting Labyrinth is a top-down 2D RPG where players explore a constantly shifting, procedurally generated maze. Players navigate the maze, collect items, battle enemies, and try to escape a prison-like world that becomes more dangerous the closer you get to the exit.</p>
      <p>This was the first game design group project I worked on at RIT. The concept was inspired by the Maze Runner movies, as well as games like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and Hades. I really liked the idea of a game where you have a home base in the center of a maze and must work your way out by mapping it out as you explore — with the twist being that the maze is constantly shifting, making that task far from simple.</p>
      <p>Making this game taught me a lot about gameplay systems design, project scope, and teamwork. I started with lofty goals that, given our timeline, we just couldn't fully realize. This experience helped me understand how to set realistic goals — a lesson I've carried into every project since. One of the most challenging tasks was designing the maze generation system to be randomized, non-repetitive, and guaranteed to produce a solvable path even as the maze shifted. I learned how to break that down into smaller components and build a modular solution that worked seamlessly with the rest of the codebase.</p>
      <p><strong>My Contributions:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Created a modular procedural maze generation system with a guaranteed path to the exit</li>
        <li>Designed enemy encounter logic and item drop tables</li>
        <li>Developed a dynamic difficulty scaling system</li>
        <li>Implemented a day/night cycle</li>
        <li>Programmed player locomotion, including an instant dash ability</li>
        <li>Created a save/load system</li>
        <li>Came up with the original idea for the game and all of the core mechanics</li>
        <li>Managed the team using agile workflows and Trello</li>
        <li>Gave weekly sprint reports to our professor</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Dungeon Heroes -->
    <div class="project">
      <img src="assets/dungeon heroes.png" alt="Dungeon Heroes" />
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Solo Developer</p>
      <p><strong>Setting:</strong> Solo Personal Project</p>
      <p><strong>Timeframe:</strong> June-December 2020</p>
      <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Unity (C#)</p>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Dungeon Heroes is an endless dungeon crawler with turn-based 8v8 combat. Players assemble a team of unique heroes and descend into an endless dungeon filled with enemies, treasures, and powerful bosses.</p>
      <p>This was the first game I made using Unity. The concept was mostly inspired by the game Soda Dungeon and classic RPGs in general. I originally created a text-based version of the game over the summer, then remade it in Unity once I started learning it in class the following semester. That semester I had a lighter course load due to COVID, so I decided to challenge myself by making a full game as a personal project alongside my schoolwork.</p>
      <p>Creating Dungeon Heroes taught me just how much goes into building a game from scratch. Everything aside from basic Unity concepts was completely new to me, and I learned a lot just by diving in and figuring things out as I went. It was the first time I made one of my game ideas truly come to life, and it really confirmed for me that game development is what I want to do.</p>
      <p><strong>My Contributions:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed and implemented the full turn-based combat system from scratch</li>
        <li>Implemented stat buffs, debuffs, and status effects</li>
        <li>Created 9 unique hero characters using a Unity character creator asset pack</li>
        <li>Designed 4-6 combat abilities per hero to differentiate their playstyles</li>
        <li>Created 9 unique pets, each providing a different party-wide buff</li>
        <li>Designed 12 unique enemies and 2 bosses, each with distinct stats and attacking abilities</li>
        <li>Built a shop system where players can buy permanent upgrades after each run</li>
        <li>Developed a combat log that displays detailed text entries for all in-battle actions</li>
        <li>Implemented a dynamic enemy scaling system to increase difficulty as the player progresses</li>
      </ul>
