    <!-- Heisteria -->
    <div class="project">
      <img src="assets/heisteria.png" alt="Heisteria" />
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Concept Creator, Project Lead, Solo Developer</p>
      <p><strong>Setting:</strong> Internship (9 person team)</p>
      <p><strong>Timeframe:</strong> January 2024-Present</p>
      <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Unity (C#), Trello</p>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Heisteria is a 2-4 player couch co-op party game with top down 3D graphics and stealth elements. Work with your friends to pull off daring bank heists in the nick of time – hold off guards, navigate security systems, crack open vaults and escape with your fortune!</p>
      <p>Heisteria was the final game I worked on at RIT, and in many ways, it felt like the culmination of everything I’d learned throughout my time there. The concept was inspired by the chaotic couch co-op games I love playing with friends — titles like Overcooked and Moving Out. It started as a class project before evolving into a full-time internship through RIT’s MAGIC Maker Program at MAGIC Spell Studios.</p>
      <p>This project pushed me to apply a blend of advanced programming, game design principles, Unity expertise, and team leadership. I led a nine-person team using agile workflows and took personal responsibility for building every core system in the game. I poured my heart into the development process, often working far beyond the required 35 hours per week to meet deadlines and deliver the best possible experience for our showcase events. Heisteria is the project I'm most proud of — not just for its quality, but for how much I grew while building it.</p>

    <!-- Pirate's Quest -->
    <div class="project">
      <img src="assets/pirates quest.png" alt="Pirate's Quest" />
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Concept Creator, Project Lead, Lead Developer</p>
      <p><strong>Setting:</strong> Academic Group Project (4 person team)</p>
      <p><strong>Timeframe:</strong> February-May 2023</p>
      <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Unity (C#), Trello</p>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Pirate’s Quest is a roguelite adventure with grid-based tactics combat. Players explore islands, assemble a crew, collect treasure, and battle enemies in a procedurally generated world. When a run ends, players earn legacy points that can be spent on permanent upgrades to improve future attempts.</p>
      <p>This was the second-to-last group project I worked on at RIT, and it remains one of the projects I'm most proud of. The concept was heavily inspired by Slay the Spire — a game I was obsessed with at the time — and also took cues from Fire Emblem, Soda Dungeon, and Into the Breach. I wanted to capture the strategic depth and replayability of those games, while experimenting with a different setting and combat system.</p>
      <p>Working on Pirate’s Quest helped me sharpen my programming and design skills by building a full tactics combat engine from scratch. I also gained experience collaborating closely with teammates to balance gameplay systems and improve player experience through iteration and feedback.</p>

      <p><strong>My Contributions:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed and implemented the full grid-based tactics combat system</li>
        <li>Generated randomized combat encounters with difficulty that scales based on run progression</li>
        <li>Created a fully scripted tutorial sequence to teach core mechanics through interactive gameplay</li>
        <li>Developed responsive visual feedback for combat events through effect popups and attack animations</li>
        <li>Programmeed unique combat abilities for each of the six crew members, emphasizing distinct playstyles and team synergy</li>
        <li>Came up with the original idea for the game and all of the core mechanics</li>
        <li>Managed the team using agile workflows and Trello</li>
        <li>Gave weekly sprint reports to our professor</li>
      </ul>
